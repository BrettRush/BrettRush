How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Interpreting user needs involves using system analysis techniques. This entails gathering feedback from previous users, making code modifications accordingly, and identifying specific inputs and outputs required for the software system.
  User stories are vital tools in Agile development to express user needs concisely. They offer a perspective on what users want to achieve with the software and provide simple requirements for the development team to follow.
  Agile processes like Crystal, Scrum, and Extreme Programming prioritize collaboration, frequent testing, and responsiveness. They offer diverse ways to manage development teams, ensure early testing, and promote effective communication between developers and users.
  A strong team member adheres to coding and design standards, maintains a sense of progress in the team, considers all project aspects, interacts positively with team members, and takes responsibility for assigned tasks.
